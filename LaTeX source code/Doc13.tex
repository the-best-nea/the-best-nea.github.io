\section{Description of the Project}

Space Exploration has advanced massively in recent years. Large companies such as NASA and SpaceX are taking large steps forward to explore and colonize new planets such as Mars. We know a lot about the planets in our solar system: We have pictures, samples and critical data about their atmospheres. This has opened a gateway allowing us access to further resources from the planets in our solar system. But, there is one "planet" that we have yet to explore in detail; a "planet" where no man-made object has never landed: Pluto. Having been recently described on Google as: \emph{"Our favourite dwarf planet since 2006"}, we have yet to discover its surface and internal composition. To continue our research of the planets in our solar system, we will need to \textbf{send a rover on a research and exploration mission to Pluto.} \\

As Pluto is extremely far away from the Earth, there are many obstacles to sending a rover to Pluto. Whilst the most obvious is transportation, NASA have already proved that they are capable of doing this using their "New Horizons" interplanetary space probe launched as part of the "New Frontiers" program. But, after getting to Pluto, there are many challenges that a rover can face. Firstly, due to the large distance between Earth and Pluto, there is a considerable delay in receiving signals, and there is also a lot of data loss. This means that the rover cannot easily be controlled remotely as there would be a large delay in sending instructions as well as receiving camera/sensor feed, which means that the camera may not represent the actual situation of the rover when the feed is received on Earth. As this poses a large threat to the condition of the rover, the best approach to address the safety of the robot is to install an autonomous navigation software, which avoids all obstacles in its path and uses other available sensors on the rover to get more information on the surroundings.\\

The information received using these sensors will be stored on the rover as well as sent to the nearest orbiting satellite, which would have been used to transport the rover as well. This satellite will then also store the data received from the rover's sensors and then will broadcast these results to Earth, allowing it to be analysed.\\

I will design a software with a friendly user interface (which will be on the companion app) that presents live information from the rover on a remote device, which can be on a satellite or on Earth to monitor the rover and receive crucial data. The rover is on Pluto to detect the presence and location of metals on the surface. My software will utilize IoT protocols to present the output of the metal detector. It will also use a built-in IR camera to perform autonomous driving. A smart algorithm will also be used to generate the relative location of the rover on Pluto's surface according to its set landing location and landing orientation. This will allow the rover's position to be estimated, as GPS cannot be utilised on Pluto. \\
 
The aim of this mission is to detect if there are metals near the surface of Pluto, if yes, then to identify and record where.\\

\section{Computational Methods}

I think that this problem lends itself well to computational methods such as abstraction and decomposition for a variety of reasons. The solution will be a software that controls the Pluto rover on a hardware level, allowing it full autonomous control as well as manual, using the rover's cameras and sensors. This will simply need to run on a computer as that will be the medium on which the images from the camera will be processes and the next course of action for the rover will be determined. There is no alternative solution for this problem that will not require a computer, due to the context of the problem, and the environment in which the solution will need to function (the harsh climate of Pluto).

\subsection{Methods Used}

Some of the computational methods used for the solution are:

\begin{itemize}
	
	
	\item{\textbf{Problem Decomposition}}
	\\This large problem can be decomposed into many smaller steps. These steps can be thought to be the 			following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Use the rover's camera system to get some RAW data about the surroundings}
		\item{Add threshold to data to limit the amount of data being passed through the program}
		\item{Plot an image representation of the RAW data}
		\item{Use image processing to detect the obstacles in the image}
		\item{Use a smart algorithm to determine the action needed to avoid obstacles}
		\item{Overwrite algorithm-determined movement with manual instructions from companion app if manual mode is enabled.}
		\item{Send instructions to a driver board (allowing hardware control to motors)}
		\item{Use an algorithm on the driver board to control the motors}
		\item{Send accurate movement of the rover to the companion app}
		\item{Calculate vector location of rover using its movement(companion app)}
		\item{Get data from the metal detector}
		\item{Send data to companion app}
		\item{Write vector location and metal detector data to local file (companion app)}
	\end{enumerate}
	After these steps are completed, the problem can be said to be solved. The steps will allow the rover to 			react to obstacles in its surroundings, allowing for autonomous navigation. Also, the steps allow the 			rover to utilise a metal detector and send its data to a server for analysis, meaning that we can get 			more information about the surroundings of the rover and the surface of Pluto. The vector location 			calculation will also allow for the rover to be located using no other hardware components, using only 			the velocity and angular velocity of the rover.
	
	\item{\textbf{Problem Recognition}}	
	\\The overall and apparat problem is autonomous navigation through an extreme terrain. But, the underlying 		and primary problem is the detection of obstacles and their location. If the obstacles can be located, 			this information can be passed through a set algorithm that will allow a motor response.
	
	\item{\textbf{Thinking Procedurally - Divide and Conquer}}
	\\All the decomposed steps above allow for the problem to be divided into smaller problems, which are easier 			to solve than the large overarching problem. Creating functions/modules to solve the smaller problems, 			and them combining them all into a larger modular program is an example of divide and conquer. 
	
	\item{\textbf{Abstraction}}
	\\Abstraction plays a large role in ensuring that the program responds to input data immediately. The 			incoming data stream from the camera sensor contains a lot of information, most of which is irrelevant 			for this application. So, it is vital to utilise abstraction and extract useful information only from 			the camera's input data. In this case, we would add a threshold so that the data only represents 			obstacles a certain distance from the camera. This allows us to reduce the amount of information being 			fed into the program, decreasing its response time and increasing its speed. The obstacles that are 		detected by the camera but are further away from the camera are removed as they do not need to be 			considered yet; these obstacles do not pose a risk of collisions yet.   

	\item{\textbf{Logic Modelling}}
	\\Logic modelling will allow me to illustrate how the program must work to fulfil the system requirements. 			It will also be helpful to depict the actual program's activities compared to its intended needs, 			allowing me to measure how successful the program is at fulfilling it's function and solving the 			problem. As this will help with the application evaluation, it will be useful when improving the program. It ensures that all the requirements are fulfilled well. 

\end{itemize}

\section{Stakeholders}

	The ideal stakeholders for this project would include the large space research firms and their representatives. They would be the clients that would use this software and adapt it for space exploration missions. But, as this is not possible right now, the stakeholders for my project will be people who have done research around artificial intelligence, space exploration and robotics. \\

	My first stakeholder will be a family relative who has completed a PhD in artificial intelligence and is current a professor at a university. I will attempt to add some type of artificial intelligence within the software so that it can learn more from its surroundings and adapt to the current situation. The university professor will use my software to create a demonstration for young student visitors during university open days. This will allow the young students to get inspired and learn more about the future application of artificial intelligence. My software will be one of the suitable solutions for the university as it will be free to use and will have a simple concept, GUI and set-up. While many alternative demonstrations of artificial intelligence on robots require a long set-up time, my software will be very simple to get ready and will be reliable so that there are not unexpected surprises on university open days.\\  

	My second stakeholder will be my schools Young Engineers groups who have engineered a prototype Pluto rover for their competition this year. They will use this software to allow their prototype rover to move across a modelled terrain of Pluto. My solution will benefit this group highly as it will allow them to test their prototype, while also testing my software in the most realistic situation that I have access to. The solution will be most appropriate to this group's needs as it will provide them with a free software that is specifically designed for their rover's hardware and is optimised for the computational power that is available to them. Other solutions would either cost a lot of money or time and would need much more computation power, making them very expensive and complex. \\

\section{Research}
	\subsection{Existing Solutions}

		As this is not a commonly commercially developed program, there are very few re-viewable examples available online. It is also very specific to the context, which may be a reason why the program is uncommon. But, if we widen the scope and look for software that are not specifically designed for this application but can be used in this context, we can find more programs online. \\\\Examples:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item{\textbf{RTAB-Map with ROS}}
				\\\\
					\begin{frame}{}
						\animategraphics[loop,autoplay,width=\linewidth]{12}{./images/rtabmap/animate_}{0}{71}
					\end{frame}
				\\
				\emph{\textbf{Overview}}
				\\\\RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping) is an open-source application which uses different SLAM (Simultaneous localisation and mapping) approaches to generate a 3D dot-cloud of the surroundings of a sensor. It can be installed and used as a stand-alone application to generate 3D dot-clouds based on sensor inputs, or can be integrated into ROS (Robot Operating System) to allow the application to control hardware according to the 3D dot-cloud generated by a camera/sensor on a robot. It produces a 3d Map of the surrounds and uses localisation to detect the robot's location in relation to the 3d generated map. it then uses this to detect obstacles and find the most efficient way around the map to a given goal location.\\\\\\ROS, which is essential in this application, is a robotics middle-ware and allows the RTAB-Map here to publish real-time messages to the appropriate nodes. In ROS, a node is a process that performs computation. Nodes are combined together in a graph and can communicate with each other to perform certain tasks. RTAB-Map, when integrated well with ROS, publishes messages to many external nodes, which communicate with hardware drivers in the system to move the robot according to RTAB-Map's instructions. As RTAB-Map can get a large image of the surroundings, it uses a smart algorithm to conduct path finding, meaning that it calculates the most efficient route to reach a destination while avoiding obstacles. \\\\As this is a complicated process, it requires a lot of advanced hardware and a high amount of processing power. ROS is also extremely difficult to use, as well as install correctly. ROS is used for many complex robots, like the Robonaut 2 aboard the International Space Station.
				\\\\
				The Graphical User Interface(GUI) that it uses displays lots of information, such as the 3d Dot-map created of the surroundings in real-time, the raw images that are being captured, and the calculation of odometry (the relative location of the vehicle). This is a simple but effective and advanced user interface that provides a lot of data that can be useful for environmental analysis, but is not hard to use. As this application is not specific to a problem, the GUI can be adjusted to display less or more information, or different information by tweaking the settings. This allows the application to be adapted to many different situations, making it ideal even for an autonomous Pluto Rover.  
				\\
				\\\emph{\textbf{Parts that I can apply to my solution}}
				\\\\
				From this application, there are many things that I can use in my application:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item{\underline{\emph{Display Odometry}}} - the application displays the odometry (relative location) of the vehicle on the GUI. This will allow the relative location of the rover to be displayed on the GUI so that the Rover can be located.
						\item{\underline{\emph{Hardware Control}}} - the software can control hardware directly by converting the output into electrical signals for the components. This will allow the Rover's motors to be controlled by my application directly.
						\item{\underline{\emph{Navigation}}} - this application can determine movement to navigate around a map with a set objective. This will be useful to move the Rover around the surface of Pluto with an objective to detect metal.
						\item{\underline{\emph{GUI settings}}} - the use of GUI settings allows the displayed information on the GUI to be adjusted according to user preference or need. This can also be helpful in low resource scenarios as displaying less information means that the program runs smoother and faster. This could be helpful on the Rover as there are limited computational resources and so the adjustment of the GUI to the scenario may be helpful in improving performance.  
					\end{itemize}

			\item{\textbf{OpenVSLAM}}
			\\\\
				\begin{frame}{}
			  		\animategraphics[loop,autoplay,width=\linewidth]{12}{./images/OpenVSLAM/animate_}{0}{70}
				\end{frame}
			\\
			\emph{\textbf{Overview}}
			\\\\
			OpenVSLAM is a monocular, stereo and RGB-D visual SLAM system similar to RTAB-Map. It is a software that uses pattern recognition to detect movement and estimate current location of the object, its odometry. But, the  large advantage with this application is that it is compatible with many different cameras and so can be used for a variety of different projects. This system is also completely modular as it is designed by encapsulating several functions in separated components with APIs. \\
	
			When comparing OpenVSLAM with RTAB-Map, we can see that RTAB-Map displays a lot more data. This is because it creates a dot-cloud with as much detail as possible to generate an accurate computational representation of its surroundings. While this data may be useful for many applications, it is not essential for obstacle detection and autonomous navigation. On then other hand, OpenVSLAM generates a simple but informative 2D birds eye map of the movement of the vehicle. It also creates a simpler dot-cloud by only detecting the presence of obstacles and not their shape, size or colour. This allows it to use minimal relevant data to navigate, which is optimal as it reduces the amount of data being processing, reducing processing time, latency and hardware demand. \\
	
			The minimal approach on this monocular SLAM software makes it more suited for our application than RTAB-Map as we have limited hardware, and an overload of unnecessary data may product uncertainty in the reliability of the software. \\
			\newpage
			\emph{\textbf{Parts that I can apply to my solution}}
			\\\\There are a few things from OpenVSLAM that I can apply to my solution:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item{\underline{\emph{Input Abstraction}}} - the ability to abstract the relevant information form the 		input device to suit the need of the software. This allows the software to be more efficient as well as 		reliable.
					\item{\underline{\emph{GUI Simplicity}}} - the GUI for OpenVSLAM is very simple and effective as it 		displays essential data making it easy to read, ensuring that there is not an overload of data being 			displayed to cause software lag as well as user confusion.

		\subsubsection{Interview Questions}

			To ensure that an interview with the stakeholders is as effective as possible, the questions to be asked will require planning so that all required information related to the solution can be communicated. \\\\
			I will first interview the \textbf{\emph{Artificial Intelligence Professor}} with the following questions.\\

			\underline{Background Questions:}
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item{\emph{How important do you think artificial intelligence to be for the Pluto rover?}}
					\item{\emph{In this case, what can artificial intelligence do that a standard algorithm cannot?}}
					\item{\emph{How will adding artificial intelligence impact the hardware utilisation of the program?}}
				\end{enumerate}

			\underline{Questions for client requirements:}
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item{\emph{What are your expectations for the GUI?}}
					\item{\emph{What hardware would you be able to use for running this software?}}
					\item{\emph{What should you be able to control remotely?}}
					\item{\emph{Would you prefer using a companion app on a computer or wiring up the embedded computer?}}
					\item{\emph{Is there anything else you would like to add?}}
				\end{enumerate}
			Apart from the above question, I may ask follow up questions or ask them to elaborate on certain answers.\\
			\\
			After completing the interview with the Professor, I will interview the \textbf{\emph{Young Engineers group}} with the following questions.\\


			\underline{Questions for client requirements:}
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item{\emph{What are your expectations for the GUI?}}
					\item{\emph{What hardware would you be able to use for running this software?}}
					\item{\emph{What should you be able to control remotely?}}
					\item{\emph{Would you prefer using a companion app on a computer over wiring up the embedded computer?}}
					\item{\emph{Is there anything else you would like to add?}}
				\end{enumerate}
			These questions are the same as the client requirement questions from the Artificial Intelligence Professor, allowing us to compare and create a collective requirements list to suit both stakeholders.\\\\
			I have included some background questions for the Professor so that I can use the answers when attempting to implementing AI into my program.  

		\subsubsection{Interview}
			\underline{Artificial Intelligence Professor:}\\

			Background Questions:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{How important do you think artificial intelligence to be for the Pluto rover?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"I think that the use of artificial intelligence is extremely important in a rover, especially if it made for Pluto as the distance between the user and the rover will be very far. Therefore, we will need something to control the rover locally without relying on a human, and so artificial intelligence will be needed."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{In this case, what can artificial intelligence do that a standard algorithm cannot?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"Well there are many things that an artificial intelligence model can be used for in this scenario. For example, it can be used to move the rover by observing its surroundings, it can be used to predict and recognize hazards. Unlike standard algorithms, it can learn more from the information it is observing, allowing it to perform better in unaccounted situations."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{How will adding artificial intelligence impact the hardware utilisation of the program?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"Well, there are many different ways of implementing artificial intelligence, so it does depend on your chosen method. But, in general, AI utilises more hardware than a standard algorithm, especially if it is constantly learning from it's environment. So, I would say that adding AI to the program will increase its hardware requirements quite dramatically."}
				\end{enumerate}
			~\\
			Questions for client requirements:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{What are your expectations for the GUI?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"In this case, it would be most effective to use a simple GUI that allows control over all vital hardware features that are accessible using the software. I would also expect to see some sort of statistics on the current state of hardware or the output of mounted sensors."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{What hardware would you be able to use for running this software?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"For demonstrations with this software,  I would have access to a computer and possibly the model rover needed for the physical demonstration. It would be ideal if I could use any computer to control the rover."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{What should you be able to control remotely?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"As the software is designed for long range control, I would expect options for manual control for as many things as possible. there are many things that can go wrong and so the user should have the choice to control all hardware possible remotely, as well as the movement of the rover obviously."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{Would you prefer using a companion app on a computer or wiring up the embedded computer?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"It would definitely be easier to use a companion app, as well as much more professional. Wiring would increase the chances of errors and make everything much more fiddly during demonstrations, and so I would definitely prefer a companion app. But, the companion app should be easy to use and should be reliable, having quick setup times as well to make it robust."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{Is there anything else you would like to add?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"I think I have said everything I would like to. Thank you."}
				\end{enumerate}
			~\\
			\underline{Young Engineers Group:}

				\begin{enumerate}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{What are your expectations for the GUI?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"A clean user interface with complex functionality allowing full control of the rover. We vision the GUI with a clean look presenting the location of the rover and a few buttons that allow full control of the rover."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{What hardware would you be able to use for running this software?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"To run the embedded app, we have a Raspberry Pi 3 that is built into our model rover. Alongside, we also have an Arduino PCD that is hardwired to all rover sensors and motors. The Arduino can also communicate with the Raspberry Pi. If needed, we also have access to a remote laptop. Regarding the rover's sensors, it has a Kinect 360 RGB-D camera along with a magnetic coil for metal detection and a receiver for a RC transmitter. The Rover also has 4 DC motors that can be used for movement. This is the hardware that we would ideally run the application on."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{What should you be able to control remotely?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"It would be nice to be able to control the rover's movement remotely to control the rover as required during testing and demonstrations. We should also be able to switch quickly between autonomous and manual control, which would helpful during presentations of the rover at events."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{Would you prefer using a companion app on a computer over wiring up the embedded computer?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"It would be helpful to have the option use a companion app but we would also want to be able to control the rover with a RC transmitter so that it can be manually controlled without having do download specific software."}
					\item{\emph{\textbf{Is there anything else you would like to add?}}}\\\\
					\emph{"One thing we would like to add is that the Kinect sensor can see objects that are not directly in front of the rover. This may need to be considered during development."}
				\end{enumerate}

		\subsubsection{Interview Analysis}

			During the interview with the University Professor, I asked a few background questions to allow me to expand my knowledge and understand the effects and impacts when attempting to add artificial intelligence to my program. From these background questions, I have learnt that adding artificial intelligence to the software would be extremely helpful for my purpose but it can have many obstacles such as higher hardware requirements.\\
			\\
			From the other questions that I asked the University Professor and the Young Engineers group, I learnt that the GUI would need to be basic in appearance but should have the ability to control all the hardware possible. It should also present statistics about the current state of the rover along with the location of the rover. Ideally, it should also allow the rover to be switched between manual and autonomous mode quickly. The program should also be extremely efficient, using very low processing power as it needs to be run on a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi 3. There are also many hardware units hardwired to this single board computer and so the program needs to be able to control those units appropriately. Remotely, both stakeholders would prefer being able to control all hardware possible, especially the movement of the rover. The software should also include a professional and easy to use companion app, as preferred by both stakeholders. While being able to control the rover using a companion app, the Young Engineers group would also want to be able to control the rover using a remote transmitter that has a hardwired receiver. At the end of the interview with the Young Engineers group, they have also pointed out that the camera sensor has a wide perspective and so can see objects that are not directly in front of the rover, meaning that the software has to differentiate between objects that are directly in front and so are an obstacle, and objects that are not in the rover's path. 

\section{Essential Features of the Proposed Solution (System Goals)}

		\underline{Embedded Application Requirements:}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Operating System with independent requirements:}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item{\textbf{Windows 7+ (x86 or x64) or Windows IoT core}} - \emph{The drivers are only officially available for these releases.}

	\subsection{Stage 3: Processing Functionality and Robustness}
	
	
	
	
		% Check if appropriate to use. It is kinda long and doubtful. Check with Sir before completing.
		To test how robust the program is, each module of the solution must be tested to ensure that  they all work as required. The lack of strength of one module can be a bottleneck and weaken the whole program, making it unreliable. This test will be a pass or fail test, where each module will either be approved or rejected. Below I will describe the expected output from each module.
		\\\\
		\noindent
		The modules to be tested and how they will be tested:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item{\textbf{Use the rover's camera system to get some RAW data about the surroundings}}\\\\ \emph{For this step to be rigid, the camera system should be able to give a continuous stream of RAW data to the Raspberry Pi for at least 5 hours.}
			\item{\textbf{Add threshold to data to limit the amount of data being passed through the program}}\\\\ \emph{This is a vital step as it can drastically increase the performance and reliability of the solution. The output of this module should be reduced size image data that displays only the closer items.}
			\item{\textbf{Plot an image representation of the RAW threshold data}}\\\\ \emph{This module will present an image representation of the RAW threshold data on the Raspberry Pi.}
			\item{\textbf{Use image processing to detect the obstacles in the image}}\\\\ \emph{This module will highlight the obstacles in the image.}
			\item{\textbf{Use a smart algorithm to determine the action needed to avoid obstacles}}\\\\ \emph{This module will output the either "right" or "left" or any other verbs to reflect the best course of action to avoid the obstacles when detected.}
			\item{\textbf{Overwrite algorithm-determined movement with manual instructions from companion app if manual mode is enabled.}}\\\\ \emph{If in Manual mode, any instructions from the companion app will replace the instructions from the smart algorithm.}
			\item{\textbf{Send instructions to a driver board (allowing hardware control to motors)}}\\\\ \emph{This module should output electrical signals over the I2C bus between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino(being used as a driver board).}
			\item{\textbf{Use an algorithm on the driver board to control the motors}}\\\\ \emph{The output from this module should be an electrical pulse sent to the DC motors to control movement.}
			\item{\textbf{Send the accurate movement of the rover to the companion app}}\\\\ \emph{The current movement of the rover will be sent to the companion app as a string to represent the direction of movement, but constant velocity will be assumed.}
			\item{\textbf{Calculate vector location of rover using its movement (companion app)}}\\\\ \emph{This module will run on the companion app and will use the current state of movement of the rover to perform vector calculations on the last vector location.}
			\item{\textbf{Get data from the metal detector}}\\\\ \emph{The output of this module will be an integer to represent the strength of the magnetic induction in the metal detector.}
			\item{\textbf{Send metal detector data to companion app}}\\\\ \emph{The output of this module will be a transfer of data from the embedded app to the companion app. This module will output integers in the companion app.}
			\item{\textbf{Write vector location and metal detector data to local file (companion app)}}\\\\ \emph{The output of this module will be a constantly updating file that holds the vector location, metal detector data and timestamps.}
		\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations}

There are quite a few limitations to this solution. The first is that the solution relies on an active internet connection to transfer data. Although the rover can be kept safe and away from obstacles without an internet connection, the rover needs it to send any data or receive instructions for manual mode. This can be an issue if used for the actual Pluto rover as it would require a satellite to orbit the planet and relay information to Earth, which can be difficult. When used for models and demonstrations, the limitations is that there needs to be an available internet connection that the rover can pair to, which can sometimes be a problem. 
\\\\
\noindent
Another limitation with this solution, is that we do not know the exact details about the terrain and atmosphere of Pluto and we have never sent a rover there, therefore the solution is optimised to our current knowledge of the terrain, which may not be accurate. This means that the solution may not use the optimal algorithm to autonomously navigate the surface of Pluto. 
\\\\
\noindent 
An additional limitation is that if a smart algorithm is used for the autonomous navigation, then it will only respond to pre-programmed circumstances and that may not always be optimal. But, when using a AI algorithm, the training will change the way it will react to unseen circumstances, and so training it on Earth may not make it optimal for Pluto terrain, meaning that it may behave unexpectedly.  
\\\\
\noindent
Another limitations that we have is to do with the available hardware. There isn't powerful hardware available in our context and so the program needs to be extremely efficient. The hardware that we have available cannot run existing solutions such as RTAB-Map and OpenVSLAM to complete the functions that we require (autonomous navigation). This means that a new approach to this problem is needed to make it more efficient and allow it to run on the limited resources available. 
\\\\
\noindent
While there are many existing solutions available that solve problems similar to ours, there are no easily accessible programs that are designed specifically for rovers. This means that there is no available help online that is specific to our context, and there is no example solution from which the basis of the application can be built. This makes developing the solution much more challenging. 

\chapter{Design}

\section{Introduction}

My project will be written using "processing 3" which is a language based on Java. Processing 3 is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment. This is primarily because it is compatible with all raspberry pi processors, and it also allows for hardware control, which I will need to control the input/output devices on the rover. The libraries that I will use are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Insert Libraries used here.}
\end{itemize}  
\noindent
Along with this, I will also use C++ to program the Arduino to work as a driver board. It will be useful for using the digital signals from the Raspberry pi to toggle on/off the motors.

\section{Explaining the Modules}

\subsection{Odometry}
\subsubsection{\normalfont User Interface}
The user will be able to view the odometry of the rover on the GUI. It will be presented as a point on a map of Pluto. This will allow the user to view the current location of the rover compared to its landing spot. The relative coordinate location will also be displayed for recording purposes.
\subsubsection{\normalfont Logical}
This module will receive the current direction of movement and the current speed of the rover and it will perform calculations (using the speed distance time formula) to move the digital model of the rover in the same direction. This aims to represent the displacement of the rover digitally, allowing the new location of the rover to be traced in relation to its landing position.

\subsection{Navigation}
\subsubsection{\normalfont User Interface}
There will be no visual aspect for the user to view the navigation of the rover as the navigation processing will be done on the rover's inbuilt computer. This is to reduce the amount of data being sent between the rover and the control station as there is highly varying feedback lag times. But, the user will be able to use buttons to control the rover when in manual control. 
\subsubsection{\normalfont Logical}
This module will use the raw data from the rover camera to detect any obstacles in its path. The depth information from the camera will be used to abstract obstacles close to the rover, posing a threat, from obstacles further away. The module will then decide the best path for the rover around the obstacle and output that.

\subsection{GUI}
\subsubsection{\normalfont User Interface}
This module will present the graphical user interface to the user using a library. It will allow buttons, maps, menus and many other assets to be represented, allowing input and retrieval of information about the rover.
\subsubsection{\normalfont Logical}
A library built into processing 3 (the programming language) will be used to create a simple GUI. It will have a large map of Pluto with the odometry of the rover, a settings menu to control the variables of the rover, a graph to represent the metal detector information, and a few other assets for the user to use.

\subsection{Communications}
\subsubsection{\normalfont User Interface}
This module will be used every time the user presses any of the buttons on the user interface. It will also constantly be used to change the location of the rover on the map. All events occurring on the user interface will either send a message to the rover (such as key pressed) or be caused due to a message received from the rover (such change in direction).
\subsubsection{\normalfont Logical}
Every time there is an event that has occurred on the rover's computer or on the user's computer, a message will be sent to the other computer to ensure that any consequent actions that need to taken have been addressed. This module allows the two computers to communicate and so work together.

\subsection{Settings}
\subsubsection{\normalfont User Interface}
The user will be able to control the angle of the camera to avoid recognizing the ground as an obstacle. The user will also be able to change the sensitivity of the camera (how far the obstacles detected can be and how much of the camera's width is used as the detection region) and they can also input the variables referring to the hardware of the rover.
\subsubsection{\normalfont Logical}
This module will be responsible for using the user inputs to change the variables that map the program to the hardware, such as the velocity and angular velocity of the rover. It will also be used to adjust the camera, which will be helpful in optimising obstacle detection and also troubleshooting and debugging the rover in case of any problems.

\section{Flowchart}

\newpage
\section{Algorithms}
\subsection{Odometry}
The first part of presenting the odometry to the user will be to connect the rover and the user's computer to the MQTT server. To do this, we will use the MQTT library, allowing us to connect and communicate using the MQTT protocol.
\\\\
\textbf{Rover AND User's Computer:}
\begin{lstlisting}
// Import the MQTT library
import mqtt.*;

PROCEDURE setup() 
 	client = new MQTTClient(this) //Create a client to connect to the server.
 	client.connect("mqtt://bca037b2:c6847c9a415bf357@broker.shiftr.io") //Specify the address of the server

\end{lstlisting}
\noindent
\\ 
Then, as the rover moves, we will need to send a message to the server to state that it is moving, along with the direction that it is moving in. To do this, we will construct a "topic" on the server named "movement". This topic will only contain messages regarding the direction of the movement of the rover, therefore if it receives a message, than we know that the rover is moving, and that message will also hold information on which direction it is moving in. This message can be read by the user's computer and can be used to perform odometry calculations.
\\\\
\textbf{Rover:}
\begin{lstlisting}

PROCEDURE move_forward() 
	//Insert code to move rover forward
	client.publish("/movement","forward") //Send message to server - Rover is moving forward
	movement_current = "forward" //Use local variable to keep track of movement 

PROCEDURE move_right() 
	//Insert code to turn rover clockwise
	client.publish("/movement","right") //Send message to server - Rover turning right
	movement_current = "right" //Use local variable to keep track of movement 

PROCEDURE move_left() 
	//Insert code to turn rover anticlockwise
	client.publish("/movement","left") //Send message to server - Rover turning left
	movement_current = "left" //Use local variable to keep track of movement 

PROCEDURE move_back() 
	//Insert code to move rover backwards
	client.publish("/movement","back") //Send message to server - Rover is moving backwards
	movement_current = "back" //Use local variable to keep track of movement 

\end{lstlisting}
\noindent
\\
\textbf{User's Computer:}
\begin{lstlisting}

PVector location_init = new PVector(500,750) //Sets initial position of the mover object on GUI

CLASS Mover {

	// Our object has two PVectors: location and velocity
	PVector location
	PVector location_relative
	Float direction
	
	PROCEDURE __init__() 
		location = location_init //Set the initial position of the object using global variable
		direction = 0.0 // Set initial direction that the object will be pointing (straight up)
		
	PROCEDURE update() 
    	PVector velocity = new PVector(0,0) //Locations changes by velocity.

    	if (inputdata.equals("forward")) 
	    	velocity = new PVector(0,-speed)
	    	velocity.rotate(direction)

    	if (inputdata.equals("left")) 
			velocity = new PVector(0,0)
			direction += -0.001
			velocity.rotate(direction)
    
    	if (inputdata.equals("back")) 
			velocity = new PVector(0,speed)
			velocity.rotate(direction)
    
		if (inputdata.equals("right")) 
			velocity = new PVector(0,0)
			direction += 0.001
			velocity.rotate(direction)
    
		if (inputdata.equals("stop")) 
			velocity = new PVector(0,0)
			velocity.rotate(direction)
      
    	//The above calculate the velocity of the rover using the fact that it is moving forward/backward or is rotating on the spot.
    
    	location.add(velocity) //Calculated the new position of the rover.
    	location_relative = new PVector(location.x - location_init.x, location.y - location_init.y) //Calculates the change in position of the rover from it's starting position, aka the Odometry.




PROCEDURE messageReceived(String topic, byte[] payload) //Procedure executed by library when a message is received
	inputdata = new String(payload)
	print(topic + "" + inputdata)
	
	if (inputdata == "forward") 
   	 	movement = "forward"
   	else if (inputdata == "right") 
   	 	movement = "right"
   	else if (inputdata == "left") 
   		movement = "left"
   	else if (inputdata == "back") 
   		movement = "back"
   	else 
   		movement = "stop"
   		
   	Mover.update() //Updates the location and direction of the "Mover" (representing the rover) every time a message is received.
  
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Navigation}
The navigation system can be used in 2 ways: autonomous navigation and manual navigation. The autonomous navigation method uses a computational approach to identify and avoid obstacles. The manual navigation can be used to override this computational approach, which can be useful for a few specific scenarios. 
\\\\
Most of the autonomous navigation processing will be done on the rover. A library will also be used to communicate with the camera sensors.
\\\\
\textbf{Rover:}
\begin{lstlisting}
import org.openkinect.freenect.*
import org.openkinect.processing.*

Kinect kinect //Declare "kinect" as a Kinect object 

//initialise variables representing obstacles (red = obstacle)
Boolean isred = false
Boolean isred_right = false
Boolean isred_left = false

PImage depthImg //declare a new image named "depthImg" (blank pixels)

//Set the threshold for the depth of obstacles detected.
float minDepth =  0
float maxDepth = 500

// A variable holds the angle of the camera
float angle


PROCEDURE setup() 
	kinect = new Kinect(this) //initialise camera object
	kinect.initDepth(); //initialise the depth of the camera
	angle = kinect.getTilt(); //initialise the tilt of the camera

	depthImg = new PImage(kinect.width, kinect.height); //Generate an image canvas - same size as camera output
	depthImg.loadPixels();

//A loop is then created with the help of processing 3 to display the image "depthImg" and update it.

PROCEDURE draw()
	// Threshold the depth image (abstract close obstacles only)
 	int[] rawDepth = kinect.getRawDepth();
 	for (int i=0; i < rawDepth.length; i++) //Loop through all pixels in image from kinect
 	   if (rawDepth[i] >= minDepth && rawDepth[i] <= maxDepth) //Select images in region
 	     depthImg.pixels[i] = color(252,3,3) //Color them red
 	   else 
 	     depthImg.pixels[i] = color(0); //Color others black
 
	// Draw the filtered image
	depthImg.updatePixels()
	image(depthImg, 0, 0)
	
	checkredright() //Used to check if there is red displayed on the right, and so if there is an obstacle on the right.
	
PROCEDURE checkredright() //Check for obstacles on right side
	isred_right = false
	for(int a=(depthImg.width / 2); a < (depthImg.width)
		for(int b=0; b < depthImg.height; b++) 					//Cycle through all pixels on right
			if(depthImg.get(a,b) == color(252,3,3)) //Check if red
				isred_right = true
  
	checkredleft() //Repeat for left side
	
PROCEDURE checkredleft() //Check for obstacles on left side
	isred_left = false
	for(int a=0; a < (depthImg.width / 2); a++)
		for(int b=0; b < depthImg.height; b++) 					//Cycle through all pixels on left
			if(depthImg.get(a,b) == color(252,3,3)) //Check if red
				isred_left = true
				
	checkred() //procedure for decision making.
	
PROCEDURE checkred() //Decision on obstacle avoidance
	if(isred_right == true && isred_left == false) 					// avoid obstacle on right
		move_left()																	// by turning left
	else if(isred_right == false && isred_left == true)				// avoid obstacle on left
		move_right()																// by turning right
	else if(isred_right == true && isred_left == true)				// avoid obstacles on both sides
		move_right()																// by turning right
	
\end{lstlisting}

For manual navigation, there is a simple code on the user side, passing messages to the rover.
\\\\
\textbf{User's Computer:}
\begin{lstlisting}
PROCEDURE keyPressed() //Sends message to rover when a key is pressed.
	if (key == 'w') 
		client.publish("/GPIOout", "forward -m")
  
	if (key == 'a') 
		client.publish("/GPIOout", "left -m")
  
	if (key == 's') 
		client.publish("/GPIOout", "back -m")
  
	if (key == 'd') 
		client.publish("/GPIOout", "right -m")
 
	if (key == 'x') 
		client.publish("/GPIOout", "stop -m")
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent
\\\\
\textbf{Rover:}
\begin{lstlisting}
PROCEDURE messageReceived(String topic, byte[] payload) //Decode message from server
	message = new String(payload) //store message data in a variable
	
	//Manually move rover according to message received
	
	if(message.equals("forward -m")) 
		movement_manual = "forward"
		move_forward()
  
	else if (message.equals("right -m")) 
		movement_manual = "right"
  		move_right()
  
	else if (message.equals("left -m")) 
		movement_manual = "left"
  		move_left()
  
	else if (message.equals("back -m")) 
		movement_manual = "back"
  		move_right()
  
	else if (message.equals("stop -m")) 
		movement_manual = "stop"
		stop()
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{GUI}
The coding for the graphical user interface will be pretty simple as processing 3 has a GUI library built in, making it easier to create basic visual assets. All of the code for the GUI will be on the user's computer as the program on the rover will not need to have a user interface. 
\\\\
Processing 3 also reserves the procedure "draw()" for presenting the GUI. It loops the contents of "draw()" allowing the GUI to be responsive.
\\\\
\textbf{User's Computer}
\begin{lstlisting}
import controlP5.* //library to add buttons
PImage img //Declare background image

cp5 = new ControlP5(this) //create a new controller for the buttons

img = loadImage("pluto-surface.jpg") //import the background image
img.resize(width,height) //resize image to fit window

PROCEDURE display_mover() //used to display mover object on the GUI
	//Create a custom shape to represent the rover on the surface of Pluto
	stroke(0);
	fill(175);
	ellipse(location.x,location.y,16,16);
	PVector line = new PVector(0, -10);
	line.rotate(direction);
	line(location.x,location.y,location.x+line.x,location.y+line.y);

PROCEDURE draw()
	size(1920, 1080) //set window width and height
	
	background(img) //apply background
	
	// Call functions on Mover object.
	mover.update()
	mover.disp() = display_mover() //add "display_mover()" method to object "mover"
	mover.disp() //Display the mover object (that represents the odometry of the rover)
	
	cp5.addToggle("ToggleAuto").setPosition(width-450,50) //Add toggle AUTO button on GUI
	   .onpress(client.publish("/GPIOout", "setauto"), 
	             client.publish("/GPIOout", "setmanual")) //When toggled, it will publish either "setauto" or "setmanual" to the server to change the mode of the rover.
	
	myChart = cp5.addChart("Metal Detector") //Add a line graph to show the info from 
               .setPosition(width-325, 50) 		//the metal detector
               .setSize(300, 200)
               .setRange(-1, 150)
               .setView(Chart.LINE)
               
    draw_settings()
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Communications}

The communications module is responsible for ensuring that the program running on the user's computer is in sync with the program running on the rover. This module utilises a lot of the library procedures and rules built into the MQTT protocol library. For each program (on user's computer and the rover), the communications module is split into the sections:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{Connecting to the server}}
	\item{\textbf{Receiving messages from the server}}
	\item{\textbf{Sending messages to the server}}
\end{enumerate}
\noindent
\\
The algorithm used for each section is identical for both the user's computer and the rover. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item\emph{{\textbf{Connecting to the server:}}}
	\\
	\begin{lstlisting}
	MQTTClient client 
	
	client = new MQTTClient(this) // Create a new client to connect to the server.
	client.connect("mqtt://bca037b2:c6847c9a415bf357@broker.shiftr.io"); // Provide server address
	\end{lstlisting}
	This process uses a MQTT broker, which is a server that can hold many MQTT packets and is used for IoT protocols. The broker being used here is "Shiftr.io", and the address of this server is provided to the MQTTClient object, which uses other procedures within the MQTT library to connect to the server.\\
	\item{\emph{\textbf{Receiving messages from the server:}}}
	\\
	\begin{lstlisting}
	PROCEDURE messageReceived(String topic, byte[] payload) //This is a procedure that is required for the MQTT library as it is called every time there is an incoming message from the MQTT server. The message is split into the "topic" and the information that it was holding, known as its "payload".
	
		inputdata = new String(payload) //this variable now holds the information received from the server and can now be used within the program.
	\end{lstlisting}
	
	\item{\emph{\textbf{Sending messages to the server:}}}
	\\Sending a message is very easy as it only requires 1 line of code and most of the processing and encoding is done by the MQTT library. It is as simple as:
	\begin{lstlisting}
	client.publish("/onthistopic", "thismessage")
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\subsection{Settings}
Settings will have a similar algorithm to the GUI, as it will use the same library that us built into processing 3, but will require different inputs and will take different actions. Some inputs will change local variables that change the way that the program runs, and some may send messages to the server to change the state of the rover.
\\\\
\textbf{User's Computer:}
\begin{lstlisting}
PROCEDURE draw_settings()
	dropdown{
			camera_tilt = textbox(""),
			detection_region_padding = textbox(""),
			depth_threshold = textbox(""),
			default_speed = textbox(""),
			default_angular_speed = textbox(""),
			cp5.button("Apply")
				.onpress( apply_settings(camera_tilt, detection_region_padding, depth_threshold, default_speed, default_angular_speed) )}
				
PROCEDURE apply_settings(tilt, padding, threshold, d_speed, d_ang_speed) //Apply the new settings
	// Send required settings to server
	client.publish("camera_tilt", tilt)
	client.publish("det_region_padding", padding)
	client.publish("threshold", threshold)
	// Change required local variables
	speed = d_speed
	angular_speed = d_ang_speed
\end{lstlisting}
\noindent
\\
The above messages sent to the rover to change settings will be received using the algorithm described previously in the communications section. After receiving the appropriate message to change the settings, the code will perform hardware changes to match the server-side changes. For example, if the camera tilt angle is changed, that the rover will push the new angle to the camera and change it to match the server.
